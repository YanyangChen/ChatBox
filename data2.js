She should teach S5 only and the Vice Principal teacher S6 in fact. We suggested the user to follow the steps as below: - <br/ <br/ 1. Make sure no user to enter subject score; <br/ 2. Reset School Information at School Management &gt; Confirm School Information; <br/ 3. Unselect all S6 classes in this cross-class subject group and save it at School Management &gt; Group for Cross-Class Subject &gt; Class Attached; <br/ 4. Create a new cross-class subject group for this subject and attached only S6 classes; <br/ 5. Create a cross-class subject sub-group at School Management &gt; Group for Cross-Class Subject &gt; Sub-Group; <br/ 6. Assign the Vice Principal name in this sub group; <br/ 7. Assign the specific students at Student &gt; Subject Setup &gt; [Search]; <br/ 8. Confirm School Information at School Management &gt; Confirm School Information."
